# extras
This directory contains extras that I use for my environment. This includes
fonts, terminal color schemes. etc.

## Inconsolata
I use a powerline patched version of Inconsolata which is included in the
powerline [font](https://github.com/powerline/fonts) repo. The fonts from this
pack can be installed on OSX or Windows using the included scripts.

## OSX terminal theme
`SolarizedDark.terminal` is a theme for the default OSX terminal. It is loosely
modified from the theme found at https://github.com/altercation/solarized in
`osx-terminal.app-colors-solarized/`.
